What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden directory that stores the metadata to start the version control of the project. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows to preview the files that are to be commited. If you have a lot of files made at different times or with different status it helps to organize the project.
