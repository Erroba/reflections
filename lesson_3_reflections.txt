When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate or when you work in different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there are could be some changes that you don't want to be public at the moment. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I wil use a fork when I would make an edition of a project and would like to give credit to the author. Clones are used to copy the project and branches are used to make experimental features to a project.
