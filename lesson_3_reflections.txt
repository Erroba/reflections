When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate or when you work in different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there are could be some changes that you don't want to be public at the moment.
